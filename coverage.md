Statement coverage: I learned that there are ways to identify all of the statements in a program and write test cases to execute each statement at least once.
Branch coverage: I learned how to identify all of the conditional branches in a program and write test cases to execute both the True and False paths of each branch.
Predicate coverage: I learned that we can identify all of the Boolean conditions in a program and write test cases to evaluate all possible combinations of these conditions.
